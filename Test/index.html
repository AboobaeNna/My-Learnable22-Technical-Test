    <h1>Test Question</h1>
    <h2>
    Given a list of integers, create a function that returns the nth-rarest item.
        the function should be called nth_most_rate signature and its signature nth_most_rate
        signature (list,n) where list is the array of integers and n is the nth rarest term. 
        For example in [5,4,5,4,5,4,4,5,3,3,3,2,2,1,5] if 2 is supplied as n, the answer is 2, 
        as 2 is the 2nd rarest item.
